<!--Steps to make a cake-->
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Get all your ingrediants <strong>weighed</strong> and <strong>measured</strong> and placed right in fron of you.
</p>
      <p>
          <strong>Step 2:</strong> First pour in the sugar <em>and</em> butter and cream them together until <strong>light</strong> and <strong>fluffy</strong>
      </p>  
      <p>
          <strong>Step 3:</strong> Then you whisk the eggs together in a <strong>separate</strong> bowl then add half of the eggs at a time and whisk them immediately. <em>If</em> they begin to <strong>kurdle</strong> then whisk harder!
      </p>
     <p>
         <strong>Step 4:</strong> After that <strong>sieve</strong> in your flour. It is <strong><em>very</em></strong> important to sieve in your flour as this adds more air to your mixture and helps it to rise. Make sure you also <em>fold in your flour!</em> 
         
        <strong><br> Also at this point you can add in any additional flavours</strong>
     </p>
     <strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you have completed all those steps then you can line a baking tray with butter -<em> or just lining!</em> and cook it for around<strong> 15-30 mins.</strong>
     <p>
    <h3>With these 5 easy steps you too can make a delicious cake!!! Once you're done your cake may look something like this:</h3>
